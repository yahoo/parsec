Parsec introduction
============

Current Version: **0.0.14-pre**

Parsec is a collection of libraries and utilities built on Maven and
Jersey2. It is designed to reduce the effort of building web service
applications, allowing you to spend more quality time elsewhere. By
using Parsec, the grunt work is handled so you can concentrate on the
logic and implementation side of development.

Parsec offers a standardized end-to-end solution to quickly bring web
service applications from concept to production. The goal of Parsec is
to:

-   Provide a standard method for building RESTFul APIs
-   Eliminate time spent in project and environment set up
-   Minimize time and effort spent on common repetitive tasks
-   Provide helper libraries and utilities for common tasks
-   Reduce the learning curve and maintenance cost

If you are building a new project with Java, Parsec is a good starting
point. See the [Getting Started](quickstart.md) section to get started
quickly.
